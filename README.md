# Multi-Signature Smart Contract Wallet

## Introduction
This project implements a simple multi-signature wallet using smart contracts. A multi-signature wallet requires multiple approvals (signatures) to authorize transactions, providing enhanced security by reducing the risk of unauthorized transfers.

## Features
* **Multiple Owners**: multiple addresses (owners) own the wallet.

* **Transaction Proposals**: Any owner can propose a transaction.

* **Approvals**: Transactions need a minimum number of approvals before execution.

* **Execution**: Once a transaction has enough approvals, it can be executed by any owner.

## How It Works
* **Deployment**: Deploy the smart contract with an initial set of owners and a required number of confirmations.

* **Propose Transaction**: Owners can propose transactions specifying the recipient, amount and calldata to be executed.

* **Approve Transaction**: Other owners can approve the proposed transaction.

* **Execute Transaction**: Once the transaction has the required number of approvals, it can be executed.
